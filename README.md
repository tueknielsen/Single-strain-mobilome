# Single-strain-mobilome

This repository contains the raw data and scripts as documentation for the analyses in the preprint "Single-strain mobilome sequencing quantifies bacterial genetic response to stress, including activity of IS elements, prophages, RNAs, and REPINs" https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.17.603846v1.article-metrics
The scripts are not published as tools for general use.


The script Single-strain_mobilome_Peaks.sh is first run in a linux terminal. Required software is specified at the top of the file.

The R script Single-strain_mobilome.R is then run in R. This script contains further analyses, plotting, and statistics.
